# iReadPackage

This package is just a lacy way to install the iReads scripts from https://github.com/genemine/iread.

The scripts have been copied from there and are just installed like that now:

```
git clone https://github.com/stela2502/iReadPackages.git
cd iReadPackages
python install.py
```

This package is just meant to install the scripts that were provided by the iReads github repo on Monday 21 okt 2024 13:42:42 CEST.
